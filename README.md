This file contains descriptions of the data files provided with the code. Only data explicitly required for running all the models have been provided. These data come from the long-term individual-based study of great tits in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK.

Following are the datasets used for analyses

(1) wytham_gretichicks_natalinfo.csv

id:unique identifier for each individual chick, broodid:unique identifier for the brood an individual belongs to, birthyear: year in which the chick hatched, natalsection:region of woodland where individual was born, birthlaydate: date when first egg of clutch was laid, april_birthlaydate: lay date in april days (number of days since april 1st), birthhatchdate: date when chick hatched, april_birthhatchdate: hatch date in april days, clutch_size: number of eggs laid in clutch, num_chicks: number of hatched chicks in brood, mean_chick_weight (not used here), mother: unique identifier for mother, father: unique identifier for father, sex (if known) - not used here, natalbox: the nestbox in which individual was born, chickweight: weight of individual at 15 days old

(2) tempdata_1965to2024.csv

Daily temperature data from Met Office Hadley Centre datasets for central England (https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/)

Contains, year, month, day, max (maximum temp), min (minimum temp) from 1965 to 2024

(3) raindata_1965to2024.csv

Daily rainfall data from Met Office Hadley Centre datasets for central England (https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/)

Contains, year, month, day, rainfall from 1965 to 2024

Code file 'computing ECEs.R' uses (1), (2), and (3)

(4) chickweight_ECEdata_5perc1perc.csv

Code to compute the variables in this dataset is in the code file 'computing ECEs.R'. It contains the same columns from (1) and the following additional variables:

hot_ece1_5: Number of hot ECEs (5% threshold) in hatchling period <br/>
hot_ece2_5: Number of hot ECEs (5% threshold) in nestling period <br/>
hot_ece1_1: Number of hot ECEs (1% threshold) in hatchling period <br/>
hot_ece2_1: Number of hot ECEs (1% threshold) in nestling period <br/>
cold_ece1_5: Number of cold ECEs (5% threshold) in hatchling period <br/>
cold_ece2_5: Number of cold ECEs (5% threshold) in nestling period<br/>
cold_ece1_1: Number of cold ECEs (1% threshold) in hatchling period<br/>
cold_ece2_1: Number of cold ECEs (1% threshold) in nestling period<br/>
rain_ece1_5: Number of rain ECEs (5% threshold) in hatchling period<br/>
rain_ece2_5: Number of rain ECEs (5% threshold) in nestling period<br/>
rain_ece1_1: Number of rain ECEs (1% threshold) in hatchling period<br/>
rain_ece2_1: Number of rain ECEs (1% threshold) in nestling period<br/>
average_temperature_per1: Average temperature during hatchling period<br/>
average_temprange_per1: Average temperature range during hatchling period<br/>
average_temperature_per2: Average temperature during nestling period<br/>
average_temprange_per2: Average temperature range during nestling period<br/>
average_rainfall_per1: Average rainfall during hatchling period<br/>
average_rainfall_per2: Average rainfall during nestling period<br/>

Code file 'Fledging weight models.R' uses (4) for analysis. 

(5) gretisurvivaldata_updated_2025.csv

This contains the same columns as (4) and 3 additional columns:

mean_ld: mean laying date of the population in given year
relative_ld: difference between individual lay date and mean_ld
local_recruitment: 0 (did not recruit) or 1 (recruited), whether the individual was recorded breeding in subsequent years

Code file 'Local recruitment models.R' uses (5) for analysis. <br/>

All models in the manuscript can be run and all figures can be reproduced from the scripts in 'Fledging weight models.R' and 'Local recruitment models.R'
